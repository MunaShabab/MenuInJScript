				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a scriptiing or programming language that is very widely on the web to make websites more dynamic and responsive . 
				It is the one language that is used on the client side , PC, Mac, Or  mobile device.JavaScriptis a very powerful and useful language that can transform a page experience
				with just few lines of code.
				According to 
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript" rel="external" title="MDN WEB">Mozzilla Developer Network</a> 
				it makes a web page more than just sit there. Using JavaScript you can make the page change or respond to certain user actions, like clicking a button or hovering over a
				menu. It can also change attributes or contents of an HTML element, for example, it can make an element appear or disappear based on a users action,
				and using the DOM there is no limit to how JavaScriptcan change a page.
				<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" rel="external" title="W3Schools">W3Scools</a> is a great website for explaining and learining JavaScript. 
				<a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/javascript/" rel="external" title="SkillCrush.com">SkillCruch.com</a> says that if you are interested in web development then 
				JavaScript is a must. it works with HTML and CSS to build dynamic web pages that meet the users needs and expectaions.It is used to automate actions that would have 
				been done manually, so changing a background color for example or adding an animation.

				<h2>PHP</h2>
				<p>
				PHP is a recursive acronym that stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, it originally stood for Personal Home Page. It is a general-purpose scripting language the is 
				used on the server-side web development and is used like javaScript it is used to create dynamic web pages.It is widely used on the web, 78.8% of the server side scripting 
				in 2007.It acts as a filter taking an input stream of content and looking at commands within its delimiters and then creating a dynamic output, mostly HTML, but it 
				can be other things, like images that is used to update the page. PHP is known for its support for a wide range of databases, wich makes creating a dynamic web content from
				a database fairly simple.

				<h2>AJAX</h2>
				<p>AJAX is an acronym that stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML,and it describes a set of development techniques used for building websites and web applications.
				Ajax makes make it possible to update web content asynchronously , meaning updating a web pge without completely reloading it. An example of that would be Google's text 
				suggestions as you starrt typing in the search bar. AJAX is a technique that coordinate the work between the client and the server to produce dynamic and responsive websites
				using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML. Moreover AJAX focuses only on the parts of a page being updated and ignores the rest resulting in faster website and content loading, it 
				basically works in the background without disturbing the look of the page where no updates are happening. When a user on a website that makes use of AJAX activates an event, JavaScript
				creates a XMLHttpRequest which is sent to the server, the server processes the request and sends the updates back to the client where it is processed by JavaScript
				and displayed on the page.

				<h2>jQuery</h2>
				<p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify accessing the HTML DOM and performing different aactions on the pages, so whatever you can do with JavaScript
				you can do the same using jQuery with much fewer words. It is designed to make it easier to navigate documents and perform common actions, jQuery takes JavaScript
				code that can many lines long and wraps it up in methods that can be called with a single line of code. According to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery" rel="external" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> it is the most widely used JavaScript library on the websites in
				the world. jQuery is described as a <q>lightweight</q> or <q> write less, do more </q> JavaScript library. It has four principles: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Separation of JavaScript and HTML</li>
					<li>Brevity and clarity</li>
					<li>Elemination of cross-browser compatibilty</li>
					<li>Extensibility:New events, elements, and methods can be easily added and then reused as a plugin.</li>
				</ul>
